# MakeAwesome();
**A simple image effect Manager for Unity**

Manage Unity's standard image effects in one inspector window, reduced to the (in my opinion) most important effects an settings. This project is currently in a really early stage please stay tuned. 
If you know how to improve MakeAwesome(); look at the contribution guidelines and/or open issues.
